    <h2>Here are some facts of saving our Rivers.</h2>
    <p>
        Why are Rivers being injured?
        <br>
        Many towns and factories are built near rivers so that they can use water from the river. But sometimes the
        water is not cleaned before it is put back into the river. This dirtying of water (also air and soil) is called
        pollution.

    <h3>
        1.Fresh water on earth is only 2.5% of the total water when 70% of the earth's surface is covered by water.
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h4>
        2.Around 70% of industrial waste is dumped to water.
    </h4>
    <br>
